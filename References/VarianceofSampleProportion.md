Unless otherwise noted, these formulas assume simple random sampling.

**Variance of sample proportion** = sp2 = pq / (n - 1)

Observations from a simple random sample can be used to estimate the variance of a population. For this purpose, sample variance is defined by slightly different formula, and uses a slightly different notation:

**s2 = Î£ ( xi - x )2 / ( n - 1 )**
