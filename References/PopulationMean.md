Population Mean:Â The mean is the average of all numbers. This code calculates Mean or Average
of a list containing numbers:

**Python program to print**

**mean of elements**

**list of elements to calculate mean**

n_num = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

n = len(n_num)

get_sum = sum(n_num)

mean = get_sum / n

print(&quot;Mean / Average is:&quot; + str(mean))

Output:

Mean / Average is: 3.0

We define a list of numbers and calculate the length of the list. We then use sum() function to get sum
of all the elements in a list. We finally divide the total sum by the number of elements in the list and we
print the result to get the mean/average of a list.
