Unless otherwise noted, these formulas assume simple random sampling.

**Sample mean** **= x = ( Î£ xi ) / n**

The mean of a sample or a population is computed by adding all of the observations and dividing by the number of observations. Returning to the example of the five teenage boys, the mean weight would equal (100 + 100 + 130 + 140 + 150)/5 = 620/5 = 124 pounds.
