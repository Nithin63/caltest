**Population Standard Deviation**: s a measure of spread in Statistics. It is used to quantify the measure of spread, variation of a set of data values. It is very much similar to variance, gives the measure of deviation whereas variance provides the squared value.

   Python code to demonstrate stdev() function 

importing Statistics module 

import statistics 

creating a simple data - set 

sample = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] 

Prints standard deviation 

xbar is set to default value of 1 

print("Standard Deviation of sample is % s "
				% (statistics.stdev(sample)))

Output :

Standard Deviation of the sample is 1.5811388300841898
