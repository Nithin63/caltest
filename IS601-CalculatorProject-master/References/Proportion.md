**Proportion**

A **proportion** refers to the fraction of the total that possesses a certain attribute.

For example, suppose we have a sample of four pets - a bird, a fish, a dog, and a cat. We might ask what proportion has four legs. Only two pets (the dog and the cat) have four legs. Therefore, the proportion of pets with four legs is 2/4 or 0.50.
