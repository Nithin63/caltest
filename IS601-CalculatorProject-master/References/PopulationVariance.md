The **Variance**

In a population, **variance** is the average squared deviation from the population mean, as defined by the following formula:

**σ2 = Σ ( Xi - μ )2 / N**

where σ2 is the population variance, μ is the population mean, Xi is the ith element from the population, and N is the number of elements in the population.
